# Feature Map Constraints Enhance Learning

## Abstract

This study explores the application of Cosine Similarity Loss to constrain individual feature maps within multi-CNN head models, aiming to promote the learning of distinct features. Our approach specifically applies this loss function across each CNN within a framework composed of multiple CNN heads, each based on variations of the SE-ResNet architecture. We evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology by conducting comparative experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, and Flower-102. The models compared include: multiple CNN heads with Cosine Similarity Loss constraints, multiple CNN heads without such constraints, and a single CNN head model. Each configuration utilizes different base models from the SE-ResNet series. This paper presents our findings, which suggest that the strategic use of Cosine Similarity Loss can significantly influence the feature-learning capabilities of CNN models, potentially leading to improvements in model performance across diverse datasets.

## Discussion

The results from our experiments clearly demonstrate that implementing Cosine Similarity Loss to guide the learning of individual feature maps can enhance model performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in the Flower-102 dataset. We hypothesize that this significant improvement is due to the homogeneity of the dataset, which consists solely of flower images. The distinct and repetitive patterns in these images likely benefit more from the differentiated feature learning enforced by Cosine Similarity Loss constraints.

Moreover, the positive outcomes observed across all datasets underline the versatility and effectiveness of our approach in diverse visual contexts. By enforcing diversity in the feature representations learned by each CNN head, we prevent redundancy and encourage the extraction of unique, informative features, which is crucial for improving generalization in machine learning models.

Our findings suggest that the strategic application of Cosine Similarity Loss can be a powerful tool in enhancing the discriminative capabilities of CNN architectures, especially in scenarios where the dataset is visually uniform or when distinct feature delineation is beneficial. Further studies could explore the application of this methodology to other types of neural networks or to tasks beyond image classification to fully determine its potential and limitations.
